## Authentication and Authorization

`Authentication` is the process of verifying the identity of a user or application, typically by requiring a valid username and password.

`Authorization` is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do, i.e., their permissions and access levels to resources.

Session-based and token-based authentication are two different approaches for managing user authentication and maintaining user sessions in web applications. Here's a breakdown of the key differences between the two:

**Token-Based Authentication**

How It Works:

1. User Login: The user provides their credentials to the server.

2. Server Validation: The server validates the credentials.

3. Token Creation: If valid, the server generates a token (typically a JWT - JSON Web Token) that encodes user information and possibly other metadata.

4. Token Storage: The token is sent back to the client and typically stored in local storage or a cookie.

5. Subsequent Requests: For subsequent requests, the client sends the token (usually in the HTTP Authorization header).

6. Server Verification: The server verifies the token (typically using a secret key or public key) to authenticate the user.

Pros:

- Scalability: Better suited for scaling as the server does not need to store session data.
- Stateless: The server does not maintain state, which simplifies load balancing and clustering.
- Cross-Domain: Tokens can be easily used across different domains, enabling SSO (Single Sign-On).

Cons:

- Token Management: Handling token expiration, renewal, and invalidation can be complex.
- Security Risks: If a token is stolen, it can be used until it expires. Additional measures (like refresh tokens) are needed for added security.
- Implementation Complexity: More complex to implement correctly, especially regarding token storage and security.
